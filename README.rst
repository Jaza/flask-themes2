Flask-Themes2
=============

Flask-Themes2 is a fork of Spirits, which is in turn a fork of Flask-Themes.

- `Spirits <https://github.com/drewlustro/spirits>`_ maintained by Drew Lustro
- `Flask-Themes <https://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-themes>`_ by Matthew "LeafStorm" Frazier

This provides infrastructure for themes in Flask.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install -e git://github.com/plausibility/flask-themes2.git#egg=flask_themes2-X.Y.Z

Documentation
-------------

Once the project is worthy, I will upload it to RTD.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install sphinx
    $ pip install -e git://github.com/plausibility/flask-themes2.git#egg=flask_themes2-X.Y.Z
    $ git clone git://github.com/plausibility/flask-themes2.git
    $ cd flask-themes2/docs
    $ make html

The documentation will be in generated in a directory called ``_build/``

Tests (a note)
--------------
I've yet to actually add functionality to the tests, so don't dare try them yet.
